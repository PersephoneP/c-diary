# C Diary.git

Author: Persephone Masalis Adonis

Created: No clue. We'll set the creation date to 19 December 2023

# Description

I wanted to create a system where I can write my thoughts and store them in a portable format. Or something like that. It's really kinda just for me to fuck around with C.

I like C now. I used to hate it because of pointers. I still hate pointers. But at least I can embrace pointer hell rather than having to avoid a language solely because of a feature that I don't like.

This may be part of a larger project. However, that will be for a later day, when I'm actually competent.
